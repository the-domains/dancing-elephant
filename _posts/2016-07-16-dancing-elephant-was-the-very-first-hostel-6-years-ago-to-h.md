  Dancing Elephant was the very FIRST hostel, 6 years ago to hit Haad Rin. The
  home of the monthly Full Moon Party!!! We are in the heart of the famous Full
  Moon Village, a bustling, multi-cultural party spot.  Surrounded by beautiful
  beaches and people. Only a 1 minute jog from the actual Full Moon Party
  putting you in the best location possible!
