* **A chill-out area** next to reception with sofas where you can relax, chat, and make new friends
* **TWO bars** -- a street bar to get started with a few beers, and then a nightclub next door 100% owned by Dancing Elephant -- we call it Mooners.
* **A travel agency** desk with tickets to all the major events, parties and activities happening in Koh Phangan.
* Free **unlimited drinking water** 24/7
* **Big screen TV** with dozens of movies
* Most of all -- **a fun-loving group of people to party with**! Dancing Elephant is a mixing bowl, you are the ingredients and the recipe is always **tasty**!
